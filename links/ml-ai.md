## Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence

- [Deep Learning AI](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/) - the best website with short courses on the AI tools. Get to know how to build own chat bot based on OpenAI API, or Meta Llama, as well as how to start with building AI agents and much more.
- [How to build multimodal RAG system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg35oYuus-w) - RAG systems allowed to load docuiments into the chat like GPT and ask questions about that document.
- [Complete Machine Learning Guide to Parameter Tuning in Gradient Boosting (GBM) in Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-gradient-boosting-gbm-python/) - Parameter tuning is a crucial step in optimizing the performance of a model. It is a process of finding the best set of parameters for a model that results in the most accurate predictions. This article will guide you through the process of parameter tuning in gradient boosting (GBM) 
- [Scikit-learn tutorial](https://github.com/ksopyla/scikit-learn-tutorial) - tutorial about scikit-learn. Especially recommendable the code for example of recall curve for random and ideal classifier accessible in metrics/precision_recall_curve_edge_case.py 
- [F1 score and it formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) - F1 score is a measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the precision p and the recall r.
- [Why is the f1 measure a harmonic mean and not an arithmetic mean of the precision and recall measures?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26355942/why-is-the-f-measure-a-harmonic-mean-and-not-an-arithmetic-mean-of-the-precision) - StackOverflow question about F1 score and why it is a harmonic mean.
