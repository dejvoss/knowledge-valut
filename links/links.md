### Programming principles
- [DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself): The DRY principle is a software development principle, which states that duplication in logic should be eliminated via abstraction; duplication in process should be eliminated via automation.
- [KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle): The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
- [YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it): The YAGNI principle states that a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.
- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID): SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
- [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle): A class, function, method should have only a single responsibility.
- [Open/Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
